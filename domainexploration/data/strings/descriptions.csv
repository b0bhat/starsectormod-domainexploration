defo_meridian,SHIP,"One of Fabrique Orbitale’s older designs, the Meridian features an odd asymmetrical design meant to carry sensors for advanced studies of space phenomena across many wavelengths. However, the powerful arrays can be used not only to analyze quantum fluctuations but to also induce them in enemy craft, destabilizing and overloading systems and shields for a short while. Like most Fabrique Orbitale ships, this light destroyer also boasts powerful survey equipment and powerful shields, with extremely subpar armor and high overhead.",,,
defo_equinox,SHIP,"The Equinox is a heavy exploration vessel designed by Fabrique Orbitale with long-range surveys in mind. This craft was often deployed by Domain survey fleets to create extremely detailed starmaps but was also used to great effect in quietly scouting, locating, and guiding planetary strikes against dissident settlements. A light hanger allows for survey drones to explore asteroids, or alternatively, bombers to deliver precision strikes, and the advanced scanner array can overwhelm the antimatter pulses of enemy engines, disabling them. However, with the incredible flexibility comes a lack of optimization and defensive capabilities, and an Equinox captain is often forced to choose one role to specialize in.",,,
defo_parallax,SHIP,"Boasting heavy offensive capabilities and an advanced flux core, this frigate can engage targets far larger than itself and mount flux-intensive weapons meant for cruisers and capitals. The Parallax’s size alone blurs the line between destroyer and frigate. By redirecting processed flux to the engines, it achieves an impressive top speed, despite lacking acceleration and turning. The addition of forward-facing hardpoints leaves it somewhat vulnerable to being flanked. The Domain often leased the Parallax from Fabrique Orbital as escorts for carriers and artillery craft, as its powerful flux array can fire in reverse and generate flux by projecting unstable energy into enemy craft, weakening their armor and hull against heavy attacks. ",,,
defo_solstice,SHIP,"A small but powerful cruiser boasting a large weapons package on top of an advanced flight deck capable of dominating the airspace, the Solstice is an adaptable cruiser capable of performing a variety of roles, whether it be carrier, close support, or screening. The Solstice was designed as a high-tech competitor for the Heron, but never won any major Armada contracts. Despite this, many exploration fleets often leased one or two in their fleets as monitors due to their long fuel range. However, one major drawback is the amount of ordnance points available, as any dedicated role will likely have to leave either mounts or fighter slots empty.",,,
defo_perigee,SHIP,"Having seen the success of the Apogee, Fabrique Orbitale attempted to incorporate their newer technologies and upscale the model, possibly hoping for another major contract with the Domain Armada. However, just like the name, as the Apogee was the highlight of the company’s revenue, the Perigee was a commercial failure despite its various improvements. Much of the new flux and shield technology was incompatible with the Apogee's unique design, causing delays in manufacturing and increasing production costs; after running several years late, the Domain Armada cancelled the contract and the program’s funding was cut with only several thousand produced. The Perigee did find a niche as a flagship for wealthy bounty hunters with its upgraded sensor package, better performance, and higher cost, but never came close to the popularity of its predecessor.",,,
defo_syzygy,SHIP,"Even with the success of the Kite on the civilian market, Fabrique Orbitale held off redesigning a military variant for many decades, with Tri-Tachyon holding a monopoly in the high-tech frigate industry. Using their older Kite design, Fabrique Orbitale refitted the Kite into a military-capable craft. The hull, shields, flux, and weapon outfits were all redesigned into a dangerous light frigate perfect for scouting roles and flanking attacks. Compared to other Fabrique Orbitale craft, the Syzygy was fairly inexpensive and powerful for its size, a perfect frigate for larger fleets and light patrols alike. ",,,
defo_syzygyews,SHIP,"The Syzygy EWS (Electronic Warfare Systems) is meant to fulfill a purely supportive role in combat, having no weapons whatsoever but equipped with a fearsome suite of technology, with powerful EMP drones similar to the Omen, electronic warfare modules scrambling and jamming enemy rangefinders and an advanced quantum disruptor capable of overloading ships. Most of the machinery, especially the burn drive, flux systems, and shields were replaced with new technology.",,,
defo_syzygycas,SHIP,"A further iteration of the ubiquitous Syzygy meant to be a support package for survey crew and rebel suppression alike, the Syzygy CAS (Close Air Support) has no mountable weapons for space combat but boasts a ground support package: a powerful array of sensors, targeting equipment, PD drones, and orbital artillery to clear the path for a survey expedition or marine invasion. All this equipment coupled with the usual fuel capacity left little room for flux capacitors and shield generators, but this ship rarely sees deployment in battle anyways. ",,,
defo_lightautopulser,WEAPON,"A scaled-down version of their Autopulse laser with rerouted capacitors, Fabrique Orbitale designed this weapon with sustained yet powerful firepower in mind. With standard flux, rate of fire, and damage, this weapon is a jack of all trades, without the burst damage, armor penetration, or specific utility of many medium energy mounts. Although other weapons beat it in specific roles, this weapon is a perfect line weapon. The only drawback to its usefulness is its higher ordnance point requirements and costs.",Assault,,
defo_empdrone,SHIP,"Built off the Coriolis frame, this EMP variant boasts a scaled-down version of the Omen’s emitter, capable of reducing missiles and other fighters to ashes. ",,,
defo_pddrone,SHIP,"A Coriolis fighter equipped instead with a Burst Laser, this craft can easily dominate the airspace.",,,
defo_coriolis,SHIP,The Coriolis frame is a heavy fighter chassis built by Fabrique Orbitale and is their main line of fighter. Its size makes it comparable to light frigates and is usually armed with the Light Autopulser capable of engaging light craft and suppressing larger craft.,,,
defo_zodiac,SHIP,"The standard freighter and tanker of the Fabrique Orbitale Survey Corps, the Zodiac has both great cargo and fuel capacity in one. One of these is capable of supplying an entire small fleet for deep space exploration. With powerful engines capable of short burns, the Zodiac can evade enemies easily and the addition of two PD corsairs gives it some defensibility other than substandard shields and minimal armor.",,,
defo_isochrone1,SHIP,"A mainstay of interstellar pacification fleets, the Isochrone is the quintessential Fabrique Orbitale cruiser. A modular ship, each section is an isolated part of the whole, with a hanger and weapon array supporting the command module. This allows the Isochrone to boast three separate flux systems and allows for three individual omnidirectional shields. Destroyed modules can also block incoming damage and buy some extra time, and overloads are compartmentalized to their section. Furthermore, the Isochrone boasts powerful thrusters which put it on par with its commercial rival, the Aurora, making it into a very powerful flanking cruiser but somewhat vulnerable to being surrounded due to its low shield coverage. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that shields can pivot independently and offer all-around defense.",,,
defo_spectra,SHIP,"An ultralight carrier consisting of a triple nanoforge core, this frigate is capable of deploying 3 separate fighter wings onto the battlefield. However, due to many constraints such as size, maintenance and life support systems this craft is only capable of fielding built-in Coriolis fighters. Often used as light support for smaller survey fleets in deep intergalactic space.",,,
